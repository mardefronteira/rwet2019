    "Invisible collaboration is a project developed for the class Electronic Rituals, Oracles and Fortune Telling. It explores the idea of communicating with someone from the past - a version of someone that was documented through text at some point in history. For that class, I developed an automatic writing tool that collaborates with you through adding words to what you are writing. It looks in Italo Calvino's books Six memos for the next millenium and Invisible cities for the word that the user inputs, and if it finds it, it chooses a word to add after it in the text.\n",
    "For Reading and Writing Electronic Text, I decided to use this same premise, but since this is not interactive, the text input has to be given as a whole. The purpose ends up being different, but I found it to be very interesting."
